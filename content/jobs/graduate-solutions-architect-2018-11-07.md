  The Red Hat Sales team is looking for four graduates to join our Graduate
  Program in the U.K. In this role, you will help us provide the first
  experience many customers have to the full value of Red Hat’s technology.
  You’ll use your technical expertise, passion for open source, and
  understanding of business processes and IT problems to help our customers
  invest in and build IT systems that improve business and society.  Working
  closely with the customers, you will help align their requirements with the
  functional capabilities of Red Hat’s solutions. If you like to solve complex
  business problems, create possibilities, and develop trusted relationships
  with customers, then this is the team for you. This is a fantastic opportunity
  to continue your personal development and professional growth in an open
  supportive environment where learning is encouraged and enabled by
  enthusiastic and collaborative individuals who want to see you flourish within
  Red Hat.






  The Red Hat graduate program offers you the technical, business and personal
  skills to establish your career. During the 18 month program, you will get the
  chance to collaborate on customer projects with other experienced Red Hat
  architects in a variety of locations across the U.K., as well as the
  opportunity to contribute to community projects and events. At the beginning
  of the program, you will be assigned a mentor and buddies to support you
  (alongside your manager).  You’ll receive regular development reviews
  throughout the program, which has been designed to ensure you gain the
  necessary training and experience to successfully transition into a more
  senior role upon completion. Your training will start with a series of
  on-boarding courses that cover our business and how you fit into it, as well
  as the skills that will help you succeed in your new role. From here, you'll
  take your first steps in your Red Hat career. We have an open and
  collaborative culture that's based on meritocracy - letting the best ideas
  win. Freedom and courage are two of our core values, which is why you need to
  be comfortable taking risks and exploring the unknown, but also how you will
  be able to make a meaningful contribution straight away.
