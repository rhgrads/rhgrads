Here's one of the best parts of working with Red Hat. The commitment to lifelong learning! We've all been entered onto "The Open Programme", run by Discovery Graduates. Over the course of 18 months we've been thrown into so many challenging situations and learned so much. You'll get the opportunity to be push yourself out of your comfort zone and make mistakes in a safe environment. I won't say too much more to avoid spoiling the experience.
