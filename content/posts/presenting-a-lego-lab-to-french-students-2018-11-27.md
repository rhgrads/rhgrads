We were tasked with aiding in the presenting of a Lego lab which was to be given to a group of french 16 year old students. This task was difficult due to the language barrier, however we managed to get them engaged, even with half of what was said needing to be translated. They initially were misunderstanding tasks, drawing two sets of eyes in the icebreaker, and writing concepts as stories, as opposed to things which could be built. The latter resulting in us requiring to create a list of our own to give them. About halfway through the session however they started to become more engaged and I feel they genuinely learnt something. They managed to start working as teams, and communicate with each other. They also started to get more comfortable talking in english and were more willing to ask questions. While the session had to be reduced in length, I feel that the students learnt from the experience and will hopefully use the skill they learnt in the future.
